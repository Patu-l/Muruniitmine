# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PASSED: Scheduling algorithm works correctly. Time slot blocking verified - booked times properly removed from available slots. Large area bookings (4 hectares) correctly block most of day. Work duration formula (area/0.4) + logistics time (1.5h) properly calculated. Available times correctly filtered within 10:00-20:00 work hours. Duplicate booking prevention works. Minor: Error handling returns 500 instead of 400 for validation errors, but core functionality is solid."

GET /api/bookings retrieves all bookings. GET /api/bookings/{date} filters by date. Date/time validation works. End time calculation includes work duration + 1.5h logistics buffer. Booking data persistence verified. Minor: Some validation errors return 500 instead of 400 status codes."

All form fields functional - area input, long grass checkbox, date picker, time selection, and customer details (name, phone, address). Form validation working correctly - shows 'Palun täida kõik väljad!' when required fields missing. Responsive design tested on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Complete booking process successful with realistic Estonian data (Kadri Mets, +372 5234 5678, Tallinn address). Success message displayed: 'Broneering edukalt tehtud! Töö ID: [booking_id]'. Submit button shows proper Estonian text '🌿 Broneeri töö' with loading state 'Broneerin...'."

Tested multiple area values (0.5ha=13.60€, 1.2ha=32.63€, 3.0ha=81.57€) - all calculations accurate using 27.19€/hectare formula. Long grass premium (25%) working perfectly: 2.0ha base price 54.38€ becomes 67.98€ with premium, showing 'Pika rohu lisatasu: 13.60€'. EUR currency formatting correct using Estonian locale. Work duration calculation accurate (area/0.4 hours). Price updates automatically when area or long grass checkbox changes.

        comment: "✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PASSED: Available time slots display works correctly. Date selection triggers API call to fetch available times with proper loading animation (spinning indicator). Future dates show 19 available time slots (10:00-19:30 in 30-minute intervals), all within business hours (10:00-20:00). Time selection dropdown populates correctly with 'Vali kellaaeg' placeholder. When no times available, shows proper Estonian message '⚠️ Valitud kuupäevaks pole vaba aega'. Loading states handled properly - spinner shows during API calls and disappears when complete. Time slots properly filtered based on existing bookings from backend scheduling algorithm."
